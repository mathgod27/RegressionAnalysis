## Sec 2.1

Advertising dataset
```{r}
fpath = getwd()
Advertising = read.csv(paste0(fpath, "/Advertising.csv"))
head(Advertising)
```

Pairwise scatterplot of sales vs TV
```{r}
# pairs(Advertising) plots all pairwise scatterplots

# the following only plots pairs that we need
pairs(~sales + TV, data = Advertising)

# alternatively, we can manually plot the scatterplot
plot(Advertising$TV, Advertising$sales,
     main = "Scatterplot of Sales vs TV Spendings",
     pch = 16,
     xlab = "TV Spendings (in thousand dollars)",
     ylab = "Sales (in thousand units)")
```
